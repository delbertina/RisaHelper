        <h3>Plugin List</h3>
        Plugins are very pog, use this info to know all about plugin stuffs. Get learned fools!
        Many of these plugins have their own wiki out on the internet that should be easy to find by google-ing the name of the plugins.
        If you still can't find the information you're looking for there are various buildings in the spawn village with copious amounts of deep information on specific information such as voting.
